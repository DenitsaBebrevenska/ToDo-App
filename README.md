# ToDo App

A simple WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) ToDo application that allows users to create a list of tasks and mark them as finished.

## Features

- Add a new ToDo: Users can input tasks and add them to the list by clicking the "List a ToDo" button or pressing Enter.
- Mark as finished: Users can click on a ToDo item to toggle its status between finished and unfinished.
- Visualize tasks: Each ToDo item is represented with a bullet point or square at the beginning of the line for better visibility.

## Acknowledgments
This app was created as a learning exercise for WPF development.
